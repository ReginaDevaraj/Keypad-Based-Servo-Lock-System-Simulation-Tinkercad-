# Keypad-Based-Servo-Lock-System-Simulation-Tinkercad-
This project focuses on designing and implementing a keypad-based servo lock system using Arduino, a 4x4 keypad, an LCD display, a servo motor, and a buzzer. The system ensures secure access control by allowing entry only when the correct password is entered.
